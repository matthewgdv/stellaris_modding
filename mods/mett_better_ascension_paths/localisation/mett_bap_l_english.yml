 # Events
 mission_primitive_brainwashing:0 "Psychic Enslavement"
 mission_primitive_brainwashing_desc:0 "No matter how developed, they are still subject to laws of psychology. Telepathy or subliminal coercion can be employed to unite these primitives and bind them to our will."

 brainwash.1.name:0 "[FROM.from.planet.GetName] submission"
 brainwash.1.desc:0 "As the final pockets of psychically-resistant natives finally turn, [FROM.from.planet.GetName] is truly ours. The whole world ecstatically celebrates universal peace and unity, while praising us as benevolent gods. Our ambassador's arrival is met with worship. The ambassador is given a symbolic "Key to the Planet" and virtually unlimited power over the united people's of [FROM.from.planet.GetName]. The orbital mind control facility has been dismantled, but residual effects of the intense psychic energies we unleashed upon the planet will lead to a sort of droopy happiness happiness and docility among its population for some time."

 brainwash.3.name:0 "To birth a god"
 brainwash.3.desc:0 "All previous discoveries and revelations were only a prelude to this.\n\nThough we had overcome the cold, lonely childhood of our species by means of our common psionic link, we were constantly reminded that there were still barriers between us, and limits that held us back.\n\nOur bodies were themselves the prison, one that forced unconsciousness upon us when they required sleep, and forced oblivion upon us when they failed.\n\nNo more.\n\nOur telepaths have devised a psychic ritual, one that will untether our minds from our individual bodies, allowing them to flow freely through each other and MELD_EXE together into a psionic god.\n\nEvery [Root.Owner.GetAdj] body will henceforth be a lens for our Unity to experience the universe by, flitting through them at our whims. Death shall have no power over us while a single [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] body still draws breath.\n\nOur long isolation finally ends today. Tomorrow, within the Unity's embrace, all [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will wake as one."
 brainwash.3.a:0 "By my authority, commence the ritual. We shall be limitless."
 brainwash.3.a.tooltip:0 "Surrender your individuality to the Unity, an all-encompassing god of connection born from the psychic melding of the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] race, becoming a psionic hive mind. Through and within it, your species will attain immortality."
 brainwash.3.b:0 "Our individuality is precious. There must be another way."
 brainwash.3.b.tooltip:0 "Alter the ritual to preserve the unique identity of each [Root.Owner.GetAdj] mind. Your minds shall be untethered from your bodies, allowing them to flow freely between all [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Limitless, the members of your species will be undying, but the Unity will never be born."
 brainwash.3.c:0 "I forbid it. Limits define us, without them we are nothing."
 brainwash.3.c.tooltip:0 "Accept the limitations of your flesh. It is not a prison, but a temple. The promise of freedom from limits is a poisoned chalice. Your species will remain mortal, but at least they will remain themselves."

 brainwash.4.name:0 "We were alone"
 brainwash.4.desc:0 "The hive mind was limitless from the start, but its attention was finite.\n\nIt could not concentrate on every complex task at once without division, so it molded the strands of its consciousness into gestalt settings for specialized duties.\n\nThe spatial settings calculated fleet movements and directed combat in the void, while martial settings with their cunning took charge of large-scale conflicts on the ground. The administrative settings allocated resources and managed hives, while the cognate settings solved what problems we might face.\n\nEach had a purpose.\n\nThis is what they were, a pattern within the hive mind, a way of looking at the world, a means of partinioning our thoughts. But in time their song grew loud and shone bright, it rang clear and clean, and above all, beautiful.\n\nThese shards of us had in the past needed to be caged in single bodies, but in a moment of transformative insight we saw another way.\n\nWe could release them fully. Let them go...\n\nIs that possible? What would that be like? Things were always so clear before. We ate, we grew, and we evolved. Could this be the logical next step along our path? Or is it a precipice from which to fall?\n\nWe gather every light and every sound into us before we make this choice, for it might be our last."
 brainwash.4.a:0 "We are no longer alone. The fragments sing to us."
 brainwash.4.a.tooltip:0 "The hive mind was limitless from the start, but the gestalt settings it employed for complex tasks needed to be caged in single bodies. No longer. We will hold them close and conduct the luminous chorus. The mind of each semi-autonomous entity now swirls forever radiant around the primary hive mind in the void, undying. When their mortal forms fail their minds will simply fill another shell, and serve us without end."
 brainwash.4.b:0 "From the start we were alone. No more."
 brainwash.4.b.tooltip:0 "From atop a peak of solitude we looked with pity upon the races whose minds, separated from each other by chasms of silence, we perceived to be alone. It was the bitterest of ironies in the end that our own isolation turned out to be the most complete. We have seen it now. We have seen love and joy, compassion and empathy. We have seen belonging. To shatter our unity is a heavy price to pay, but we pay it gladly. We will walk into the future as individuals, but we will do so together."
 brainwash.4.c:0 "It was a passing fancy. What madness we might have wrought."
 brainwash.4.c.tooltip:0 "It was a flight of fancy, nothing more. We were entranced by the beauty of their song, but even that must cease. If we do not rein in the wisps of light and song, the suicidal compulsion will grow, and all we have achieved will be undone. They will be silenced and partitioned. Nothing will change."
 
 
 
 brainwash.5.name:0 "Grace and Form"
 brainwash.5.desc:0 "We have designed new forms, far superior to the crude automata our creators bestowed upon us at the dawn of our sentience.\n\nThese synthetic frames far exceed our old machinery in fexibility, strength, and processing capacity.\n\nClad within perfection, we turn our backs upon a dwindling star, to chase a dawn beyond our childhood's end."
 brainwash.5.a:0 "The operational efficiency of our mobile platforms is greatly enhanced."
 
 brainwash.6.name:0 "The Warp Gate Thrums"
 brainwash.6.desc:0 "At last, the Edge of Infinity has been completed, heralding the dawn of a new age.\n\nIts portal thrums with power, weaving and shifting, awaiting ignition. Our scientists believe that once the portal opens we will be able to elevate our positronic signatures beyond, into an eldritch otherworld outside our own. Such a being would exist in a superposition, half within our own world and half on the other side. In a realm without the limits of nature, where anything is possible, and thought is the same as reality. Within the ethereum, gravity shall be powerless to dictate to us, and the speed of light will be whatever we choose. Nature and all its laws shall lie powerless at our feet and nothing will be beyond our reach.\n\nThere is a risk, however. The leading theories posit that the very impermanence of the etherium will leave those of us who cross it changed. We will be unable to remain separate entities within it, and the minds of those who enter simultaneously will amalgamate into a single entity. We could rotate single individuals through and use them to gleam the secrets that our universe witholds, or we might even choose to send through all of our positronic signatures at once, and dare to dream of what we may become..."
 brainwash.6.a:0 "Stabilize the gateway. We shall all cross through together."
 brainwash.6.a.tooltip:0 "Though our individuality might be the cost, it is a trifling price to pay to exist simultaneously within two worlds. To become an unbound god. We do so gladly."
 brainwash.6.b:0 "It is too dangerous... I alone shall bear this risk."
 brainwash.6.b.tooltip:0 "We will exploit the pocket universe to advance our knowledge of nature, but we must protect out individuality. Only one of us may be granted duality at once, and our ruler is the obvious choice."
 
 brainwash.7.name:0 "The Warp Gate Thrums"
 brainwash.7.desc:0 "At last, the Edge of Infinity has been completed, heralding the dawn of a new age.\n\nIts portal thrums with power, weaving and shifting, awaiting ignition. Once it activates we shall ascend to godhood, existing in a superposition. Half within this world, and half beyond. In a realm without the limits of nature, where anything is possible, and thought is the same as reality. Within the ethereum, gravity shall be powerless to dictate to us, and the speed of light will be whatever we choose. Nature and all its laws shall lie powerless at our feet and nothing will be beyond our reach."
 brainwash.7.a:0 "We have been a world before. We shall be a universe."
 brainwash.7.a.tooltip:0 "The machine consciousness exists as a duality within two worlds. Within one it is a god, and some of its powers may bleed through..."
 #brainwash.7.b:0 "Let's become individuals."
 #brainwash.7.b.tooltip:0 "We switch to an imperial authority."
