 #Hab buildings
 
 building_hab_power_hub_1:0 "Solar Power Hub I"
 building_hab_power_hub_1_desc:0 "A complex that controls the storage and transmission of solar power collected by the habitat. The more advanced it is, the more effective our Solar Collectors here will be." 
 building_hab_power_hub_2:0 "Solar Power Hub II"
 building_hab_power_hub_2_desc:0 "A complex that controls the storage and transmission of solar power collected by the habitat. The more advanced it is, the more effective our Solar Collectors here will be." 
 building_hab_power_hub_3:0 "Solar Power Hub III"
 building_hab_power_hub_3_desc:0 "A complex that controls the storage and transmission of solar power collected by the habitat. The more advanced it is, the more effective our Solar Collectors here will be." 
 building_hab_power_hub_4:0 "Solar Power Hub IV"
 building_hab_power_hub_4_desc:0 "A complex that controls the storage and transmission of solar power collected by the habitat. This hub is highly advanced, but exceeding its effectiveness is at least theoretically possible." 
 building_hab_power_hub_5:0 "Solar Power Hub V"
