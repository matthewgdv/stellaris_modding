Guilli's planet modifiers has a file that starts with many z's and overrides most colony types.

The copy of this file that starts with '~' is here to ensure it is loaded after Guilli's mod,
but the original is being left in so that diffing against vanilla files (and other mods) 
happens correctly

Make sure to keep these two files in sync!
