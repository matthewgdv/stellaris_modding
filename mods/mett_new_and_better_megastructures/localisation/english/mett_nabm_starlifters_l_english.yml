 # Star Lifter Site construction
 star_lifter.6.name:0 "Star Lifter Construction"
 star_lifter.6.desc:0 "Harnessing the power of the stars has been a dream of [Root.GetAdj] engineers throughout history - from crude combustion to the pale imitation of solar fusion - we now stand ready to realize this dream. In the [From.From.GetName] system rests the scaffold upon which we will build a Star Lifter, encompassing [From.From.GetName] and monopolizing the star's very essence."
 star_lifter.6.a:0 "Soon, we will have incomprehensible resources."
 # Starlift Frame built
 star_lifter.7.name:0 "Star Lifter Frame"
 star_lifter.7.desc:0 "With the Star Lifter frame now in place, the awesome scale of the project is evident to all.\n\n[From.From.GetName] burns in a spindly cage, but will eventually be completely surrounded by [Root.GetAdj] solar panels and gravilifts."
 star_lifter.7.a:0 "Excellent."

 # Star Lifter partially completed
 star_lifter.8.name:0 "Star Lifter stage infrastructure Installed"
 star_lifter.8.desc:0 "While not yet complete, with the installation of advanced solar harvesters, we have begun to use the energy of the [From.From.GetName] star to power the gravilifts and matter conversion plant.\n\nThe matter and energy demands will only continue to increase as construction continues, and matter conversion is further optimized."
 star_lifter.8.a:0 "One more step..."

 # Star Lifter completed
