# Ethics
####################################
 ethic_authoritarian:0 "Authoritarian"
 ethic_authoritarian_desc:1 "§LIn the state of nature life is solitary, nasty, poor, brutish, and short. It is only when people come together and surrender their powers and liberties to a single entity wielding a monopoly on violence, that civilization truly begins. We forget it at our peril.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_authoritarian:0 "Fanatic Authoritarian"
 ethic_fanatic_authoritarian_desc:1 "§LThe government must be not only be the highest power in the empire, but the only one. Proper order can only be maintained through structure, discipline, and absolute obedience.§!\n"

 ethic_egalitarian:0 "Libertarian"
 ethic_egalitarian_desc:1 "§LGovernment may be a necessary evil, but that does not mean we must empower it to destroy all that we've achieved. Restricting the power of the government to the bare minimum it requires to function is the only means by which a nation might be saved from tyranny.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_egalitarian:0 "Fanatic Libertarian"
 ethic_fanatic_egalitarian_desc:1 "§LWhat right have distant so-called rulers to demand tax, service, or obedience of any other? A society that does not prioritize the absolute liberty of all its members above the agendas of power-hungry would-be despots is not a society - it is a crime.§!\n"
 
 
 ethic_socialism:0 "Collectivist"
 ethic_socialism_desc:1 "§LSociety works best when none are left behind, and this is best achieved by means of a government that redistributes wealth and stewards the means of production in the name of the people. In removing the inequality of individual greed and fallibility, we will be better placed to map the stars, guided not by our own individual gain, but that of society as a whole. §!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_socialism:0 "Fanatic Collectivist"
 ethic_fanatic_socialism_desc:1 "§LIt is only when we have renounced our preoccupation with "I," "me", and "mine" that we can truly possess the world in which we live. In entering the void of space, we must set aside our disunity and greed, and recognize that everything belongs to everyone else. §!\n"
 
 ethic_capitalism:0 "Individualist"
 ethic_capitalism_desc:1 "§LThe core mechanism of expansion is a process of accumulation: one in which our profits reaped from the sale of goods and services can be reinvested into the furthering of our own prosperity. It would be unwise to forget the merits of such a system, especially with the unparalleled new opportunities afforded us by our galactic expansion.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_capitalism:0 "Fanatic Individualist"
 ethic_fanatic_capitalism_desc:1 "§LThere is no greater imperative than the pursuit of personal wealth and prosperity. By setting our people against each other, ever greater fruits will be illuminated by the sparks of their clashing ambitions as they grow their fortunes. Only the best may become successful and rise to the fore of our civilization, and what is good for the best of us, is good for all of us.§!\n"
 

 ethic_industrial:0 "Industrialist"
 ethic_industrial_desc:1 "§LRapid and efficient infrastructure development is a fundamental necessity in any civilized society. Special attention must be paid to our workers in order to ensure future economic prosperity. Whatever cost we incur is a small price for the future we assure ourselves.§!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_industrial:0 "Fanatic Industrialist"
 ethic_fanatic_industrial_desc:1 "§LThrough our inventions, we are capable of raising civilization from dust and bending the forces of nature to our will. At our command, the planets relinquish their riches and magnificent factories scoop them up. This power demands to be used, and through its use, we shall remake the galaxy in our own image.§!\n"

 ethic_green:0 "Ecologist"
 ethic_green_desc:1 "§LThe true values of a planet lie in its natural resources: its atmosphere, its flora and fauna, and its landscape. Our success so far lies in our ability to preserve and maintain these assets, whilst at the same time benefitting economically and societally from them. These biological systems are the sustaining wealth of any civilisation, and we would do well to remember that. §!\n"
 ethic_fanatic_green:0 "Fanatic Ecologist"
 ethic_fanatic_green_desc:1 "§LNo musician can compose a melody so profound as the songs of wildlife and the whispers of the trees. No artist can capture the ineffable majesty of mountain tops, secluded lakes, or vast caverns. Whether by design or by chance, we have been born into a universe of transcendent natural beauty and our imperative is to preserve it.§!\n"
 
 
 ethic_elitist:0 "Elitist"
 ethic_elitist_desc:0 "Everybody isn't fit for any role in the great scheme of things. Skills, responsabilities, strengths of characters, qualities aren't equaly distributed, and some are better to lead and rule, others are better when lead and ruled over; everyone benefits from this."
 ethic_fanatic_elitist:0 "Fanatic Elitist"
 ethic_fanatic_elitist_desc:0 "Society is a herd, with sheperds and watchdogs; society is a struggle, with winners and losers. The wide mass of the lesser need the lead of the destined few who have the power, meaning and capability to watch and channel them into shape and purpose. Some are born, chosen or risen to position over the unpurposeful, the errant, the lost, the narrowminded, the restrained, or the filth. Some are better than others." 
 
 ethic_pluralist:0 "Egalitarian"
 ethic_pluralist_desc:0 "Society has a tendancy of restraining the possibilities of a citizen through factors out of his grasp, like birth, money or networks, limiting its own richness, diversity, and thus gains. Helping everyone so they have the same chances in life is both just and meaningful."
 ethic_fanatic_pluralist:0 "Fanatic Egalitarian"
 ethic_fanatic_pluralist_desc:0 "Everybody comes into this world with the same potential, on the biological level. Society as a whole should leave this potential free, by endorcing absolute equal rights, accessibilities, possibilities and sociological mobilities for everyone in it. The whole is made stronger for this, and the morality is made brighter."
